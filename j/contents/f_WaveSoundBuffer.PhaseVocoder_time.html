<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>
		 Represents the scale along the time axis. You can also set this value.<br />
		 The value can be any real number greater than 0. However, extremely small values will increase CPU load and, in the worst case, may prevent playback. Also, sound quality deteriorates when the value exceeds approximately 1.95, and increasing the overlap may not improve the quality (due to the characteristics of the internal algorithm).<br />
		 Specifying 1.0 does not change the time axis scale (playback speed remains unchanged).<br />
		 For example, specifying 1.5 increases the time axis scale by 1.5 times, resulting in slower playback (it will take 1.5 times longer to play).<br />
		 For example, specifying 0.5 decreases the time axis scale by 0.5 times, resulting in faster playback (it will play at double speed).<br />
		 Even if both the time and pitch properties are 1, the Phase Vocoder filter still operates, causing slight sound quality degradation and consuming CPU time. If you intend to keep both at 1, it is better to remove this filter from the filter array.<br />
		 Changes to this property are reflected in real-time, but due to buffering, it takes about 2 seconds before the change is actually heard in playback. Also, noise may occur during the transition.
