<h1><a id="id100" name="id100">About the File Corruption Check Tool</a>
</h1><div class="para"><div>
 Data can become <a id="id101" name="id101" class="targanchor"><dfn>corrupted</dfn></a> due to issues during installation or computer malfunctions after installation.<br />
 The "File Corruption Check Tool" is a tool for detecting such "corrupted" files.<br />
<br />
 To detect file corruption, you must first sign the distribution files using the <a target="main" class="jump" href="SignTool.html">Key/Signature Tool</a>.<br />
 The File Corruption Check Tool also verifies the validity of those <a id="id102" name="id102" class="targanchor"><dfn>digital signatures</dfn></a> (files whose validity cannot be confirmed are treated as "corrupted" by this tool).<br />
 The files to be checked are those located in the same folder as the File Corruption Check Tool and its subfolders (it also searches subfolders). Therefore, please place this tool in the installation folder.<br />
 This tool only checks files that have been signed; it does not check unsigned files. However, as an exception, the KiriKiri core (and executables created with Releaser) will always have their signatures checked, so please ensure the KiriKiri core is signed.<br />
<br /><div class="note"><div class="notehead"><span class="noteheadspan">Note</span></div>
The File Corruption Check Tool can detect file corruption, but it cannot detect the state of "file does not exist" by itself.<br />
If you suspect missing files are the cause of an error, you can use the "Copy Results" button to copy the list of checked files to the clipboard. You can then have the end user send this list to you for investigation.<br />
</div><br />
</div></div>

<h1><a id="id103" name="id103">Configuration File for the File Corruption Check Tool</a>
</h1><div class="para"><div>
 The main executable for the File Corruption Check Tool is "File Corruption Check Tool.exe" located in the enduser-tools folder, and its configuration file is "File Corruption Check Tool.ini".<br />
 You must write the settings for the File Corruption Check Tool here and distribute it along with the tool itself.<br />
<br /><div class="note"><div class="notehead"><span class="noteheadspan">Note</span></div>
 If you change the name of "File Corruption Check Tool.exe", please change the name of the configuration file as well. For example, if you rename it to "Signature Verification Tool.exe", the configuration file should be "Signature Verification Tool.ini".</div><br />
The configurable items are explained below.<br />
<dl>
<dt>[message] section - notice</dt>
<dd> Specifies the message to be displayed at the top of the screen.<br />
 Lines starting with notice= must be written on a single line (without line breaks), but you can insert a line break by writing [cr].</dd>
<dt>[message] section - caption</dt>
<dd> Specifies the string to be displayed in the window's title bar.<br />
</dd>
<dt>[key] section - publickey</dt>
<dd> Specifies the <a id="id104" name="id104" class="targanchor"><dfn>public key</dfn></a> used for verifying digital signatures.<br />
 Copy and paste the public key directly here (without writing anything like "setting_name=").<br />
</dd></dl> Please refer to the standard "File Corruption Check Tool.ini" (included in the KiriKiri 2 SDK distribution files) for an example.</div></div>
<h1><a id="id105" name="id105">Usage</a>
</h1><div class="para"><div>
<br />
 When you start File Corruption Check Tool.exe, the following screen will be displayed.<br />
<img width="400" height="393" alt="sigchk.png" src="sigchk.png" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<dl>
<dt>File List</dt>
<dd> Displays a list of files to be checked.<br />
 The "Status" column will display one of the following: "Checking", "Unchecked", "Normal", or "Corrupted".<br />
 If a file is corrupted, it will be displayed as "Corrupted".<br />
</dd>
<dt>Check</dt>
<dd> Starts the check.<br />
 Checking large files takes time.</dd>
<dt>Copy Results</dt>
<dd> Copies the results to the clipboard.<br />
 This is useful for having end users send you the check results.<br />
 Once the check is complete, the button becomes enabled (clickable).<br />
 The results are tab-delimited data, containing (from left to right) the filename, file date, file size, and check result.<br />
 Additionally, a list of all files and directories in the target directory is also copied. If there is a possibility that unexpected files exist, you can check them by looking at this output.<br />
</dd>
<dt>Close</dt>
<dd>Closes the window.</dd></dl></div></div>
