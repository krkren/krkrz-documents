<h1><a id="id81" name="id81">Environment-Dependent Issues</a>
</h1><div class="para"><div>
These are issues in KiriKiri caused by problems in the end-user's (secondary user's) environment and their countermeasures.<br />
While we strive to prevent environment-dependent issues during KiriKiri's development, because computer settings and configurations are extremely diverse, environment-dependent issues will inevitably occur.<br />
While some specific symptoms can be addressed individually, please generally take the following measures:<br />
<ul><li>Update drivers to the latest stable versions</li><li>Disable resident programs (especially antivirus software, memory cleaners, window appearance modifiers, Windows-compatible shells, and others prone to conflicts with other software)</li><li>Check the computer with various diagnostic tools ("Check Disk" (standard OS tool), <a target="_top" class="jump" href="http://www.memtest86.com/">memtest86</a>, etc.)</li><li>Check if there is sufficient free space on the HDD</li><li>Refer to <a target="_top" class="jump" href="http://homepage2.nifty.com/winfaq/">WinFAQ</a> (Mr. Oda's page) etc. to see if similar symptoms have occurred and handle them accordingly</li><li>Boot into Safe Mode once, then restart in Normal Mode</li><li>If using a CPU accelerator, there may be restrictions on specific CPU functions. Please read the CPU accelerator manual carefully; in some cases, you may need to disable specific CPU features in the engine settings (e.g., disable SSE for <a target="_top" class="jump" href="http://buffalo.melcoinc.co.jp/qa/cpu/b4590010.html">http://buffalo.melcoinc.co.jp/qa/cpu/b4590010.html</a>)</li><li>Reinstall the OS</li></ul>Most options that can be set for the KiriKiri engine exist to address environment-dependent issues. Please also see the <a target="main" class="jump" href="CommandLine.html">Command Line Options</a>.<br />

<h1><a id="id82" name="id82">Environment-Dependent Symptoms</a>
</h1><div class="para"><div>
In the following, "Engine Settings" refers to the configuration tool for end-users (engine_settings.exe).<br />


<dl>



<dt>Installed data is corrupted</dt>
<dd>Symptoms include read errors such as "A read error occurred," freezing during execution, "EAccessViolation" errors, and other unpredictable behavior.<br />
Since the installed data may be corrupted, please use a "File Corruption Check Tool" or similar to verify the integrity of the installed data.</dd>

<dt>Freezing during screen transitions or skipping</dt>
<dd>If freezing occurs during frequent screen drawing, such as screen transitions or skipping in KAG, there may be an issue with the display driver.<br />
Check if the display driver version is the latest stable one; if it is old, please update it to the latest stable version.<br />
Alternatively, changing the "Double Buffering Method" or "Wait for Vertical Sync" settings in the "Engine Settings" may improve the situation.<br />
If you are using the "nView Desktop Manager" utility included with NVIDIA graphics cards, please uninstall or disable this utility.<br />
</dd>
<dt>Screen drawing is abnormally slow</dt>
<dd>If screen drawing is abnormally slow, especially when KiriKiri scales images in full-screen mode or when double buffering is explicitly enabled, changing the "Double Buffering Method" or "Wait for Vertical Sync" settings in the "Engine Settings" may improve the situation.<br />
Also, if scaling is performed by the engine rather than the monitor, performance may degrade due to the scaling. In this case, setting "Screen Resolution in Full Screen" to "Closest Resolution" in the Engine Settings will allow the display to handle the scaling, though some displays may not show the image with the correct aspect ratio.</dd>
<dt>Screen remains black or image is distorted</dt>
<dd>If the screen remains black, the image is distorted, or the application freezes, especially when KiriKiri scales images in full-screen mode, changing the "Double Buffering Method" or "Wait for Vertical Sync" settings in the "Engine Settings" may improve the situation.<br />
</dd>

<dt>Video playback fails</dt>
<dd>If video playback via overlay fails (errors are displayed, freezing occurs), or if freezing occurs immediately after video playback, disabling hardware acceleration may improve the situation. In the "Display Properties" (right-click the desktop, select "Properties"), go to the "Settings" tab, click the "Advanced" button, and in the "Troubleshooting" tab of the resulting dialog, try moving the "Hardware Acceleration" slider from "Full" toward "None" step by step.<br />
It is also recommended to provide a setting on the script side to disable video playback.<br />
Alternatively, changing the "Double Buffering Method" or "Wait for Vertical Sync" settings in the "Engine Settings" may improve the situation.<br />
</dd>


<dt>Sound stutters, stops playing, or freezes during playback</dt>
<dd>Depending on the sound card or environment, playback may stutter, contain noise, or stop being audible midway. In some cases, symptoms such as freezing only during sound playback may occur.<br />
If this occurs during transitions or heavy effects, it may be improved by setting "General System - Low Priority" to "Yes" or "General System - Reduce CPU Usage" to "Yes" in the Engine Settings.<br />
Additionally, changing the "Sound - DirectSound Software Mixing" setting in the Engine Settings may also help.<br />
Alternatively, open "Multimedia" (or "Sounds and Multimedia" or "Sounds and Audio Devices Properties") in the Control Panel, go to the "Audio" tab, click "Advanced" under "Sound Playback," and try moving the "Hardware Acceleration" slider on the "Performance" tab gradually toward "None.".<br />
</dd>
<dt>Controls do not work properly</dt>
<dd>If software such as mouse movement assistants or mouse gesture tools are resident, you may be unable to operate the work. Please disable such resident software.<br />
Using third-party (non-standard OS) mouse drivers may cause issues with the control system. In such cases, please disable or uninstall the third-party driver and use the standard OS driver.<br />
If a gamepad (joystick) is connected in gamepad-compatible software, malfunctions in the pad may prevent operation. Please check if an object is resting on the pad, causing a button to be held down.<br />
Also, in some environments, if a gamepad (joystick) is not connected, it may be detected as having buttons pressed. In such cases, please disable the gamepad driver.<br />
Issues may occur if the center calibration of the gamepad or joystick axes is insufficient. In this case, please calibrate the game controller via "Game Controllers" in the Control Panel.<br />
If you cannot disable the pad driver, you can set KiriKiri not to use the pad. Please set "Enable Gamepad" to "No" in the Engine Settings.<br />
If using a third-party mouse driver, wheel input may not work. In this case, setting "Mouse Wheel Rotation Detection Method" to "Window Message" in the Engine Settings may improve the situation.<br />
</dd>

<dt>Frequent thrashing occurs</dt>
<dd>Frequent thrashing (excessive swapping in and out) may occur due to insufficient memory.<br />
Setting "General System - Memory Usage" to "Low" in the Engine Settings may improve this.<br />
However, since this reduces performance, you might instead keep the "General System - Memory Usage" option as is and set "Graphics - Image Cache Limit" to a relatively low value like "4MB" or "8MB" to reduce memory usage without significantly impacting performance.<br />
