<h1><a id="id83" name="id83">About KiriKiri Configuration</a>
</h1><div class="para"><div>
    "KiriKiri Configuration" is a tool that allows you to configure KiriKiri options via a GUI.<br />
    It exists to allow end users (secondary users) to perform troubleshooting and performance adjustments to some extent by themselves.<br />
    The engine configuration is started by adding -userconf to the KiriKiri executable file.<br />
<br />
    The option names, available values, and descriptions use information built into the KiriKiri core.
</div></div>
<h1><a id="id84" name="id84">About Configuration Files</a>
</h1><div class="para"><div>
    There are two types of KiriKiri configuration files. One is placed in the same location as the KiriKiri executable, with the extension changed to <a id="id85" name="id85" class="targanchor"><dfn>cf</dfn></a>. The other is placed in the data storage location specified by the <a target="main" class="jump" href="CommandLine.html">command line option</a> -datapath, with the extension changed to <a id="id86" name="id86" class="targanchor"><dfn>cfu</dfn></a>.<br />
    The .cfu file is generated by the "Engine Configuration (-userconf)" for end users.<br />
    If settings are made with the Releaser, a .cf file is created. Note that the set options will not be reflected unless this file is distributed along with the KiriKiri core.<br />
    These files will be created if they do not exist when the engine configuration is started and the OK button is pressed.<br />
<br /><div class="note"><div class="notehead"><span class="noteheadspan">Note</span></div>
Inside the configuration file, descriptions of "name=\"value\"" are listed line by line. The "value" part is a sequence of \xNN, where each represents a Unicode code point value. For example, if opt="\x61\x62\x63\x3042\x3044\x3046" is written, this represents "abc" followed by Japanese characters. Please be careful when writing to these files from other applications.<br />
Note that if you write it without using the \xNN format, such as opt="abc(Japanese characters)", the KiriKiri core can recognize it correctly, but the Engine Configuration tool may not recognize this format and might not work as expected. Double quotes on both sides of the value are also required.</div><br />
